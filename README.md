# Asimov
> Text Analysis Engine and Automated Proofreader

### Goal
Build a easy-to-use utility that can serve as an automated writer's aid.

### Functionality

It performs a series of basic proof-reading checks and compiles a list of errors found and suggested edits. (For example: highlighting typos and punctuation errors, suggesting active voice over passive voice, heavily repeated words, etc.) 

Along with checks, it also generates a statistical breakdown of key figures that the writer might find useful, such as estimated reading time and readability test results.

### Requirements
1. [x] Accept String Input
2. [ ] Accept Stream/Buffer Input (CLI)
3. [x] Run from CLI
4. [ ] Run as a library/module
5. [x] Calculate writing stats
